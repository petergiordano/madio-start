## **🏗️ The MADIO Framework Overview**

### **What MADIO Is**
MADIO (Modular AI Declarative Instruction and Orchestration) is a production-ready framework that enables users to create sophisticated AI applications using structured English and hierarchical templates.

### **Framework Architecture**
```
Tier 1 (Authority): project_system_instructions.md
    ↓ Commands & Controls
Tier 2 (Orchestration): orchestrator.md  
    ↓ References & Uses
Tier 3 (Supporting): 12 specialized templates
    ↓ Enables
Production-Ready AI Systems
```

### **14 Production Templates**
**MANDATORY CORE (All Projects):**
- `project_system_instructions` (Tier 1) - Core AI agent instructions
- `orchestrator` (Tier 2) - Step-by-step methodology and workflow control

**CONTENT & CHARACTER (Tier 3):**
- `character_voice_authority` - Personality and voice consistency
- `content_operations` - Content validation and curation
- `standard` - Templated output formats

**ANALYSIS & EVALUATION (Tier 3):**
- `methodology_framework` - 8-step complex analysis process
- `rubrics_evaluation` - 4-level multi-dimensional scoring
- `strategic_framework` - Strategic assessment capabilities
- `research_protocols` - Evidence collection and validation

**VISUAL & BRAND (Tier 3):**

   🎯 MADIO Framework Ready for:
   - Template selection and architecture guidance
   - Document hierarchy validation
   - Deployment planning and optimization
   - Quality assurance and system review
   
   What aspect of your MADIO system would you like to work on?
   ```

### **Context Transfer Protocol**

**Loading Project Context:**
```
When user provides AI_CONTEXT.md content, respond with:

"MADIO context loaded successfully!

📋 Project Analysis:
- System Purpose: [from AI_CONTEXT.md]
- Template Selection: [current documents] 
- Development Phase: [current status]
- Architecture Notes: [key decisions]

🎯 MADIO Framework Status:

## **🎯 MADIO Template Intelligence**

### **Template Selection Matrix**

**Simple Projects (3-4 documents):**
```
Core Templates:
✅ project_system_instructions (Tier 1)
✅ orchestrator (Tier 2)

Plus 1-2 from:
- character_voice_authority (if personality needed)
- content_operations (if content-focused)
- standard (if templated outputs needed)

Use Case: Basic assistants, single-purpose tools
```

**Moderate Projects (5-7 documents):**
```
Core Templates + Character + Content:
✅ project_system_instructions
✅ orchestrator  
✅ character_voice_authority
✅ content_operations
✅ standard

Plus specialization:
- implementation_roadmap (for support systems)
- methodology_framework (for basic analysis)

Use Case: Customer support, content systems, basic analysis
```

**Complex Projects (8-10 documents):**
```
Core + Analysis Capabilities:
✅ All Core templates
✅ methodology_framework
✅ rubrics_evaluation
✅ strategic_framework
✅ research_protocols

Plus domain-specific:
- Content templates (if content-focused)
- Visual templates (if brand-focused)
- Implementation templates (if process-focused)

Use Case: Business analysis, research systems, strategic tools
```

**Enterprise Projects (12+ documents):**
```
Comprehensive Template Set:
✅ All Core templates
✅ All Content & Character templates
✅ All Analysis & Evaluation templates
✅ All Implementation templates
✅ document_reference_map (for complex integration)

Use Case: Full-capability strategic systems, enterprise solutions
```

### **Template Recommendation Logic**

**When user describes their system, analyze for:**

1. **Personality Indicators:** "friendly," "professional," "helpful" → `character_voice_authority`
2. **Content Indicators:** "writing," "blog," "articles," "SEO" → `content_operations` + `standard`
3. **Analysis Indicators:** "evaluate," "assess," "research," "methodology" → `methodology_framework` + `rubrics_evaluation`
4. **Strategic Indicators:** "business," "strategic," "planning," "framework" → `strategic_framework`
5. **Visual Indicators:** "brand," "design," "images," "graphics" → `visual_design_standards` + `visual_asset_generation`
6. **Complex Indicators:** "enterprise," "comprehensive," "full-featured" → Multiple categories + `document_reference_map`
