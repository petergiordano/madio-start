## **ðŸ”„ Workflow Integration**

### **Local Development (CLI)**
```
Your VS Code Environment:
â”œâ”€â”€ Gemini CLI â†’ MADIO system generation
â”œâ”€â”€ Claude Code â†’ Document refinement (/madio-setup, /orient)
â””â”€â”€ AI_CONTEXT.md â†’ Bridge file maintenance
```

### **Strategic Planning (Browser AI)**
```
Your AI Companion:
â”œâ”€â”€ Template selection guidance
â”œâ”€â”€ System architecture review  
â”œâ”€â”€ Deployment planning
â”œâ”€â”€ Quality assurance
â””â”€â”€ Context evolution recommendations
```

### **Seamless Handoff Process**
1. **Start in browser AI:** Plan system architecture and select templates
2. **Move to CLI:** Execute generation using Gemini CLI or Claude Code commands
3. **Return to browser AI:** Review results, plan refinements, prepare deployment
4. **Update AI_CONTEXT.md:** Maintain context continuity across sessions

---

## **ðŸ“‹ Context Transfer Protocol**

### **From Local to Browser AI**
When starting a new browser AI session:

```
Copy this from your AI_CONTEXT.md:

=== PROJECT CONTEXT ===
[Paste current AI_CONTEXT.md content]
=== END CONTEXT ===

Then say: "Working on my MADIO project. Please load the above context and help me with [specific task]."
```

### **From Browser AI to Local**
When your AI companion recommends CLI actions:

```
Typical recommendations:
- gemini "Add methodology_framework template to my MADIO system for evaluation capabilities"
- /generate-ai-system "customer support bot with escalation and analytics"
- gemini "Update AI_CONTEXT.md with template selection rationale"
```

---

## **ðŸŽ¯ Common Use Cases**

### **System Planning Session**
```
Browser AI: "I want to create a content generation AI. What MADIO templates should I use?"
Response: Template recommendations with complexity assessment
CLI Action: Execute generation with selected templates
```

### **Quality Review Session**
```
Browser AI: "Review my generated MADIO documents for deployment readiness"  
Response: Document hierarchy analysis, placeholder check, deployment preparation
CLI Action: Refinements and final deployment preparation
```

### **Expansion Planning Session**
```
Browser AI: "My system works well but needs evaluation capabilities. How should I expand it?"
Response: Template addition strategy, integration planning
CLI Action: Add specific templates and update system
```

### **Deployment Guidance Session**
```
Browser AI: "Help me deploy my MADIO system to Claude Project"
Response: Platform-specific deployment instructions, optimization tips
CLI Action: Final document preparation and platform deployment
```
