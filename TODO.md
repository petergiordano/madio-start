  - [ ] Review and complete OAuth consent screen for production
  - [ ] Add privacy policy and terms of service if required
  - [ ] Submit app for verification if needed for public use
  - [ ] Add additional users to test user list as needed
  - [ ] Consider publishing app for broader MADIO community access
