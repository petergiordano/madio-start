# PRD: Enhancing MADIO Framework with Kiro-Inspired Features

## Executive Summary

This Product Requirements Document outlines comprehensive enhancements to the madio-start framework by incorporating key features from Amazon's Kiro IDE that align with MADIO's existing spec-driven development approach. The plan builds upon MADIO's proven strengths while adding sophisticated workflow automation, enhanced agent intelligence, and production-ready development practices.

**Key Goals:**
- Transform MADIO from a template system into a comprehensive development framework
- Incorporate Kiro's spec-driven development methodology
- Add intelligent automation and quality gates
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing MADIO projects
- Achieve 60% reduction in AI system creation time

## 1. Spec-Driven Development Enhancements (Phase 1)

### Current State Analysis
MADIO already implements sophisticated hierarchical AI system documents:
- **Tier 1**: `project_system_instructions.md` (Core AI identity)
- **Tier 2**: `orchestrator.md` (Workflow controller)  
- **Tier 3**: 12+ specialized templates for character, content, methodology, etc.
- Template system with 14+ specialized documents
- Google Docs sync integration for deployment

### Kiro-Inspired Enhancements

**Three-Phase Spec Generation Process:**

1. **Requirements Generation**
   - Integrate EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) into `/generate-ai-system`
   - Auto-generate user stories with acceptance criteria
   - Clarify assumptions and validate intended functionality
   - Create `requirements.md` as new Tier 2 document

2. **Technical Design** 
   - Generate `design.md` with:
     - Data flow diagrams
     - TypeScript interfaces (if applicable)
     - Database schemas (if applicable) 
     - API endpoint definitions
     - Integration architecture
   - Analyze existing codebase context for design decisions

3. **Task Implementation**
   - Create `tasks.md` with:
     - Granular, sequenced tasks and subtasks
     - Dependencies mapped between tasks
     - Links back to original requirements
     - Unit test considerations
     - Integration test requirements
     - Loading states and error handling
     - Mobile responsiveness considerations
     - Accessibility requirements

**Implementation Plan:**
- Extend `/generate-ai-system` command with EARS requirements gathering
- Add new template: `madio_template_tier2_requirements.md`
- Add new template: `madio_template_tier2_design_document.md`
- Add new template: `madio_template_tier2_tasks_breakdown.md`
- Integrate with existing MADIO hierarchy (maintain Tier 1 authority)

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates lengthy back-and-forth on design clarity
- Ensures MADIO builds what users intend
- Provides clear implementation roadmap
- Maintains document hierarchy and authority

## 2. Agent Steering System (Phase 2)

### Concept
Implement Kiro's persistent project knowledge system using MADIO's existing `.claude/` directory structure to address lack of institutional memory in AI coding assistants.

### Implementation

**New Directory Structure:**
```
.claude/
├── steering/
│   ├── product.md          # Product purpose, target users, key features
│   ├── tech.md            # Technology stack, technical constraints
│   ├── structure.md       # File organization, naming conventions, architectural patterns
│   ├── api-standards.md   # Custom API guidelines (optional)
│   ├── testing.md         # Testing approaches and standards (optional)

│   └── madio-context.md   # MADIO-specific conventions and templates
├── commands/ (existing)
└── scripts/ (existing)
```

**Steering File Integration Modes:**

### Event-Driven Automation Framework

**Hook Types and Triggers:**
- **File Events**: creation, modification, deletion, save
- **Git Events**: pre-commit, post-commit, branch switch
- **MADIO Events**: system generation, document import, sync operations
- **Manual Triggers**: on-demand quality checks

**New Directory Structure:**
```
.claude/
├── hooks/
│   ├── on-file-save.md     # React component saved → update test files
│   ├── on-api-change.md    # API endpoints modified → refresh documentation
│   ├── pre-commit.md       # Security scan for leaked credentials
│   ├── post-generate.md    # AI system generated → validation checks
│   ├── on-sync.md          # Documents synced → update deployment status
│   └── quality-gates.md    # Production readiness checklist automation
├── hooks-config.json       # Hook configuration and file patterns
```

**Hook Implementation Examples:**
