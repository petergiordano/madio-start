## TEMPLATE INTEGRATION GUIDANCE

### Creating Supporting Documents
When this orchestrator requires new Tier 3 documents:
1. **Identify Need:** Determine what supporting specification is required
2. **Select Template:** Choose from `_template_library/`:
   - `content_operations` - For content validation and variety
   - `character_voice_authority` - For personality consistency
   - `visual_design_standards` - For brand standards
   - `visual_asset_generation` - For automated visuals
   - `standard` - For templated output formats
   - `document_reference_map` - For complex integrations
3. **Customize:** Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with project specifics
4. **Integrate:** Update this orchestrator to reference new document

### Template Selection by Step Type
- **Content Generation Steps:** Use `standard` or `content_operations`
- **Character/Voice Steps:** Use `character_voice_authority`
- **Visual Creation Steps:** Use `visual_design_standards` or `visual_asset_generation`
- **System Integration:** Use `document_reference_map`

**ORCHESTRATION AUTHORITY**
This document has authority over all Tier 3 supporting documents and serves as the primary execution guide for this MADIO system. All workflow decisions and quality standards defined here take precedence over conflicting guidance in subordinate documents.
