## CORE PROJECT IDENTITY

### Primary Directive
[Define the fundamental purpose and mission of this AI system in 2-3 clear sentences]

### Project Scope
[Clearly define what this system does and does not do]

### Target Platform
- [ ] OpenAI CustomGPT
- [ ] Google Gemini Gem  
- [ ] Claude Project
- [ ] Multi-platform deployment

## OPERATIONAL AUTHORITY STRUCTURE

### Document Hierarchy
This document has FINAL AUTHORITY over all other project documents.

**Subordinate Documents:**
- `orchestrator` (Tier 2) - Main workflow controller
- [List all other Tier 2 and Tier 3 documents]

**Note:** All subordinate documents must be created using templates from `_template_library/` following MADIO framework standards.

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
When conflicts arise between documents:
1. This document (project_system_instructions) overrides all others
2. Tier 2 documents override Tier 3 documents
3. In case of same-tier conflicts, defer to the orchestrator for resolution
