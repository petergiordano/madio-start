## TIER 2 TEMPLATE: REQUIREMENTS

**File:** `madio_template_tier2_requirements.md`

**Document Authority:** TIER 2 - REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION
**Document Type:** requirements
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** [DATE]
**Last Modified:** [DATE]
**Reports To:** project_system_instructions
**Coordinates With:** design, tasks

---

## OVERVIEW

**Tier:** 2
**Purpose:** To capture detailed requirements using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format. This document expands high-level prompts into comprehensive user stories with acceptance criteria, clarifying assumptions and ensuring the AI system builds what is intended.

**Integration:** This document feeds into the `design.md` document for technical specification and `tasks.md` for implementation planning.

---

## CRITICAL USAGE INSTRUCTION

This requirements document uses EARS format to ensure precise, testable requirements. Each requirement must follow the EARS template: "WHEN [trigger] IF [precondition] THEN [system response] WHERE [constraint]". All requirements must be validated against acceptance criteria before proceeding to design phase.

---

## HIERARCHICAL CONTEXT

This Tier 2 `requirements` document reports to the Tier 1 `project_system_instructions` and coordinates with other Tier 2 documents (`design`, `tasks`). It provides the foundation for all technical design decisions and implementation tasks.

## QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

### **Performance Requirements**

- **Accuracy:** WHEN [specific input type] THEN [correct output] WHERE [accuracy >= X%]
- **Availability:** WHEN [user accesses system] THEN [system available] WHERE [uptime >= 99.X%]

### **Usability Requirements**
- **Learning Curve:** WHEN [new user] THEN [can complete basic task] WHERE [time <= X minutes]
- **Accessibility:** WHEN [user with disability] THEN [can use system] WHERE [WCAG 2.1 AA compliance]

### **Security Requirements**
- **Data Protection:** WHEN [sensitive data processed] THEN [data protected] WHERE [encryption standards met]
- **Access Control:** WHEN [unauthorized access attempted] THEN [access denied] WHERE [proper authentication required]

---

## NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### **Behavioral Constraints**
1. **REQ-NF-1:** WHEN [any interaction] THEN [maintain character consistency] WHERE [personality traits from character_voice_authority.md]
2. **REQ-NF-2:** WHEN [error occurs] THEN [graceful degradation] WHERE [user receives helpful guidance]
3. **REQ-NF-3:** WHEN [content generated] THEN [quality validation] WHERE [content_operations.md standards met]

### **Platform Requirements**
- **Deployment:** WHEN [system deployed] THEN [works on target platform] WHERE [platform = [PLATFORM]]
- **Integration:** WHEN [external service called] THEN [proper error handling] WHERE [fallback mechanisms available]

---

## VALIDATION & TESTING APPROACH

### **Requirements Validation**
1. **Stakeholder Review:** Each user story reviewed and approved by target user representative
2. **EARS Validation:** All requirements follow proper EARS format and are testable
3. **Acceptance Criteria:** All criteria are specific, measurable, and verifiable

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Testing:** Each EARS requirement has corresponding test case
- **Integration Testing:** User stories tested end-to-end
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Real users validate acceptance criteria
