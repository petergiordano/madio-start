## OVERVIEW

**Tier:** 3
**Purpose:** To provide a standardized, flexible framework for creating a multi-phase implementation roadmap for any project. This template translates strategic recommendations into a sequenced, actionable plan with clear goals, deliverables, and success metrics for each phase.

---

## CRITICAL USAGE INSTRUCTION

This template is used to execute **Step 7 (Phased Implementation Plan)** of the `Methodology Framework`. It must be populated based on the prioritized recommendations from the `Prioritization Matrix` (Step 6). Each phase must have a clear goal and defined initiatives.

---

## HIERARCHICAL CONTEXT

This Tier 3 `implementation_roadmap` is a direct output of the analysis and recommendation steps of the `Methodology Framework`. It is the primary execution plan used by the `orchestrator` to guide the project from strategy to completion.

---

## WHEN TO USE

Use this template when you need to:
- Translate a set of strategic recommendations into a project plan.
- Create a clear, multi-phase execution roadmap for any initiative.
- Define the goals, actions, deliverables, and metrics for each stage of a project.
- Communicate the project plan to stakeholders, including teams, owners, and leadership.

---

## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

- **Inputs:** Requires the finalized `Strategic Recommendations` (Step 5) and `Prioritization Matrix` (Step 6) from the `Methodology Framework`.
- **Dependencies:** This roadmap is a critical input for project management tools and team assignments.
- **Outputs:** A completed, multi-phase implementation plan that guides the execution of the project.

# [PROJECT_NAME]: Phased Implementation Roadmap

## Roadmap Overview

**Project Goal:** [State the single, overarching goal of the entire implementation plan.]

**Total Estimated Timeline:** [e.g., 3-6 Months]

**Guiding Principles:**
- **[PRINCIPLE_1]:** (e.g., Balance quick wins with long-term strategic initiatives.)
- **[PRINCIPLE_2]:** (e.g., All actions must be tied to a measurable success metric.)
- **[PRINCIPLE_3]:** (e.g., Maintain flexibility to adapt based on phase-end reviews.)

---

## Phase 1: [PHASE_1_NAME] (e.g., Foundational Fixes & Baseline Establishment)

**Timeline:** [e.g., Weeks 1-4]

**Goal:** [Clearly define the primary objective of this phase. e.g., "To address all critical gaps and establish baseline metrics for future measurement."]

| Key Initiative / Action | Key Deliverable(s) | Owner(s) | Dependencies | Success Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [INITIATIVE_1]**<br>_Addresses Root Cause: [ROOT_CAUSE_A]_ | - [DELIVERABLE_1A]<br>- [DELIVERABLE_1B] | [TEAM/ROLE] | [DEPENDENCY_1] | - [METRIC_1A]<br>- [METRIC_1B] |
| **2. [INITIATIVE_2]**<br>_Addresses Root Cause: [ROOT_CAUSE_B]_ | - [DELIVERABLE_2A] | [TEAM/ROLE] | [DEPENDENCY_2] | - [METRIC_2A] |
| **3. [INITIATIVE_3]**<br>_Addresses Root Cause: [ROOT_CAUSE_C]_ | - [DELIVERABLE_3A]<br>- [DELIVERABLE_3B] | [TEAM/ROLE] | [DEPENDENCY_3] | - [METRIC_3A]<br>- [METRIC_3B] |

**Phase 1 Review:** At the end of this phase, a milestone review will be conducted to align stakeholders on completed changes, early impact indicators, and next-phase priorities.

---

## Phase 2: [PHASE_2_NAME] (e.g., Core Process & Value Proposition Optimization)

**Timeline:** [e.g., Weeks 5-10]

**Goal:** [Clearly define the primary objective of this phase. e.g., "To optimize the core value proposition and streamline the primary user journey based on foundational insights."]

| Key Initiative / Action | Key Deliverable(s) | Owner(s) | Dependencies | Success Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [INITIATIVE_1]**<br>_Addresses Root Cause: [ROOT_CAUSE_D]_ | - [DELIVERABLE_1A]<br>- [DELIVERABLE_1B] | [TEAM/ROLE] | Completion of Phase 1, [DEPENDENCY_1] | - [METRIC_1A]<br>- [METRIC_1B] |
| **2. [INITIATIVE_2]**<br>_Addresses Root Cause: [ROOT_CAUSE_E]_ | - [DELIVERABLE_2A] | [TEAM/ROLE] | [DEPENDENCY_2] | - [METRIC_2A] |
| **3. [INITIATIVE_3]**<br>_Addresses Root Cause: [ROOT_CAUSE_F]_ | - [DELIVERABLE_3A] | [TEAM/ROLE] | [DEPENDENCY_3] | - [METRIC_3A] |

**Phase 2 Review:** A milestone review will assess the impact of core optimizations and validate the plan for the next phase.

---

## Phase N: [PHASE_N_NAME] (e.g., Scaling & Advanced Capabilities)

**Timeline:** [e.g., Months 3-6]

**Goal:** [Clearly define the primary objective of this phase. e.g., "To scale successful processes and build advanced capabilities that create a sustainable competitive advantage."]

| Key Initiative / Action | Key Deliverable(s) | Owner(s) | Dependencies | Success Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [INITIATIVE_1]**<br>_Addresses Root Cause: [ROOT_CAUSE_G]_ | - [DELIVERABLE_1A] | [TEAM/ROLE] | Completion of Phase N-1 | - [METRIC_1A] |
| **2. [INITIATIVE_2]**<br>_Addresses Root Cause: [ROOT_CAUSE_H]_ | - [DELIVERABLE_2A]<br>- [DELIVERABLE_2B] | [TEAM/ROLE] | [DEPENDENCY_2] | - [METRIC_2A]<br>- [METRIC_2B] |

**Phase N Review:** Final project review to assess overall impact against the project's main goal and initial baseline metrics.

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

- **Roadmap Adherence:** Over 90% of initiatives are completed within their designated phase and timeline.
- **Goal Achievement:** Each phase successfully meets at least 80% of its defined success metrics.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** All phase-end reviews are successfully completed with stakeholder sign-off for the subsequent phase.

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

- [ ] Is the overall project goal clearly stated?
- [ ] Is each phase given a descriptive name, timeline, and clear goal?
- [ ] Does every initiative in the roadmap table trace back to a specific root cause from the analysis?
- [ ] Are deliverables, owners, dependencies, and success metrics defined for each initiative?
- [ ] Is the plan logically sequenced, with dependencies from earlier phases correctly identified?
- [ ] Does the roadmap balance short-term fixes with long-term strategic actions?
- [ ] The document adheres to all MADIO Tier 3 template requirements.
