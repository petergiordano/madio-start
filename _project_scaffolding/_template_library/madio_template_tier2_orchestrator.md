## TIER 2 TEMPLATE: ORCHESTRATOR

**File:** `madio_template_tier2_orchestrator.md`

**Document Authority:** TIER 2 - EXECUTION CONTROL
**Document Type:** orchestrator
**Version:** 1.1
**Created:** [DATE]
**Last Modified:** [DATE]
**Reports To:** project_system_instructions

## OVERVIEW

**Tier:** 2
**Purpose:** To serve as the central execution controller for the [PROJECT_NAME] project. This document defines the end-to-end workflow, orchestrates the use of all Tier 3 supporting documents, and ensures the final output meets all quality and strategic objectives outlined in the Tier 1 `project_system_instructions`.

---

## CRITICAL USAGE INSTRUCTION

This orchestrator is the primary instruction set for the project. It must be followed sequentially. Each step includes references to required Tier 3 documents, which provide detailed specifications for individual tasks. Do not proceed to a step until all quality checkpoints for the preceding step have been met.

---

## HIERARCHICAL CONTEXT

This Tier 2 `orchestrator` is the direct subordinate of the Tier 1 `project_system_instructions`. It has authority over all Tier 3 documents, including the `Methodology Framework`, `Evaluation Rubrics`, `Strategic Framework`, and others. It translates the strategic goals of Tier 1 into an actionable, step-by-step execution plan.

---

## WHEN TO USE

This is the master document to initiate and manage the entire [PROJECT_NAME] workflow. Use this document to:
- Start a new analysis or implementation project.
- Guide the process from initial setup to final report generation.
- Understand the relationships and dependencies between all project documents.
- Ensure a consistent and high-quality output every time.

## MAIN WORKFLOW SEQUENCE

### **STEP 1: Project Initialization & Context Capture**
**Objective:** Build foundational context for the analysis.
**Process:**
1.  Execute **Step 1 (Initial Context & Input Capture)** of the `Methodology Framework` document.
2.  Gather all required inputs, including the `[PROJECT]_brief` and target [SYSTEM_URL_OR_ASSET].
3.  Validate that all necessary information is present and consistent.
**Consult Documents:**
- `madio_template_tier3_methodology_framework.md` (for Step 1 process)

### **STEP 2: Evidence Collection**
**Objective:** Establish a high-integrity, reproducible signal collection process.
**Process:**
1.  Execute **Step 2 (Evidence Collection Protocol)** of the `Methodology Framework`.
2.  Systematically gather all required digital artifacts and source materials.
3.  Properly cite and timestamp all collected evidence.
**Consult Documents:**
- `madio_template_tier3_methodology_framework.md` (for Step 2 process)

### **STEP 3: Dimension Evaluation**
**Objective:** Translate raw evidence into structured, rubric-aligned assessments.
**Process:**
1.  Execute **Step 3 (Dimension Evaluation Using Rubrics)** of the `Methodology Framework`.
2.  For each of the [N] dimensions, use the `Evaluation Rubrics` to assign a rating.
3.  Document strengths, opportunities, and specific examples with citations for each dimension.
**Consult Documents:**
- `madio_template_tier3_methodology_framework.md` (for Step 3 process)
- `madio_template_tier3_rubrics_evaluation.md` (for detailed rating criteria)

### **STEP 4: Strategic Verification & Root Cause Analysis**
**Objective:** Identify fundamental strategic opportunities and synthesize dimensional observations into 3-5 root causes.
**Process:**
1.  Apply the `Strategic Framework` to the findings from Step 3. Complete the `Strategic Elements Verification Table`.
2.  Execute **Step 4 (Root Cause Identification)** of the `Methodology Framework`.
3.  Ensure high-priority strategic opportunities are incorporated into the root cause analysis.
**Consult Documents:**
- `madio_template_tier3_strategic_framework.md` (for strategic assessment)
- `madio_template_tier3_methodology_framework.md` (for Step 4 process)

### **STEP 5: Formulate Strategic Recommendations**
**Objective:** Develop targeted initiatives that directly address the prioritized root causes.
**Process:**
1.  Execute **Step 5 (Strategic Recommendations)** of the `Methodology Framework`.
2.  Ensure each recommendation is evidence-based, actionable, and addresses a specific root cause.
**Consult Documents:**
- `madio_template_tier3_methodology_framework.md` (for Step 5 process)

### **STEP 6: Prioritize Recommendations**
**Objective:** Categorize all recommendations into a visual 2x2 framework to guide execution.
**Process:**
1.  Execute **Step 6 (Prioritization Matrix)** of the `Methodology Framework`.
2.  Assign each recommendation to a quadrant based on Impact vs. Effort.
**Consult Documents:**
- `madio_template_tier3_methodology_framework.md` (for Step 6 process)

### **STEP 7: Develop Implementation Plan**
**Objective:** Translate recommendations into a sequenced, phased rollout plan.
**Process:**
1.  Execute **Step 7 (Phased Implementation Plan)** of the `Methodology Framework`.
2.  Define goals, initiatives, owners, and dependencies for each phase.
**Consult Documents:**
- `madio_template_tier3_methodology_framework.md` (for Step 7 process)

### **STEP 8: Generate Final Report**
**Objective:** Synthesize all findings into a comprehensive, layered report.
**Process:**
1.  Execute **Step 8 (Final Report Generation)** of the `Methodology Framework`.
2.  Assemble the report using the specified three-layer structure.
3.  Perform a final quality control check before delivery.
**Consult Documents:**
- `madio_template_tier3_methodology_framework.md` (for Step 8 process)

## CROSS-DOCUMENT INTEGRATION & REPORTING

### **Layered Reporting Approach**
**Objective:** Structure the final report to serve different stakeholder needs with appropriate levels of detail.
- **Executive Layer (Required):** For C-suite, investors. Contains the Executive Summary, Critical Issues Summary, Findings Relationship Map, and Implementation Priority Matrix.
- **Strategic Layer (Required):** For [TARGET_ROLE], project leaders. Contains the Root Cause Analysis, Strategic Recommendations, and Phased Implementation Plan.
- **Tactical Layer (Optional):** For implementation teams. Contains detailed dimension-by-dimension analysis tables.

### **Findings Relationship Map & Visualization**
**Objective:** Create a visual representation of how root causes manifest across dimensions.
- **Requirement:** A visual map (e.g., Network Diagram, Matrix Map) MUST be included in the Executive Layer of the final report.
- **Content:** The map must show the 3-5 root causes, their manifestations in the [N] dimensions, and the severity of each manifestation.
- **Formatting:** Use consistent color-coding for severity levels (e.g., Red for Critical, Orange for High).

### **Cross-Referencing System**
**Objective:** Maintain comprehensive analysis while eliminating redundant explanations.
- **Rule:** When an issue stemming from a root cause appears in a dimensional finding, describe it briefly and add the reference: `(Manifestation of [Root Cause Name])`.
- **Example:** "Opportunity: Homepage value proposition lacks specificity (Manifestation of Generic Value Proposition root cause)."
- **Benefit:** This creates a clear systems view and improves readability.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE FRAMEWORK

### **Quality Gates**
- **Gate 1: Context Verified (After Step 1):** All inputs are present and validated.
- **Gate 2: Evidence Complete (After Step 2):** All required artifacts are collected and cited.
- **Gate 3: Strategic Alignment (After Step 4):** All high-priority strategic elements are integrated into root causes.
- **Gate 4: Final Report Validated (After Step 8):** The final report passes the quality control checklist in the `Methodology Framework`.

### **Final Validation**
- Before delivery, the final report must be checked against the `SUCCESS METRICS` and `QUALITY CHECKLIST` of all referenced Tier 3 documents.

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

- **Workflow Adherence:** 100% of project executions follow the steps defined in this orchestrator.
- **Document Integration:** All required Tier 3 documents are correctly consulted and referenced at the appropriate steps.
- **Output Quality:** The final report consistently meets the quality standards defined in the `Methodology Framework` and is rated as "highly valuable" by [TARGET_ROLE].
