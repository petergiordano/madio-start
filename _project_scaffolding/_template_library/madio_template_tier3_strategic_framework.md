## TIER 3 TEMPLATE: STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK

**File:** `madio_template_tier3_strategic_framework.md`



**Document Authority:** TIER 3 - SUPPORTING SPECIFICATION
**Document Type:** strategic_framework
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** [DATE]
**Last Modified:** [DATE]
**Reports To:** orchestrator

## OVERVIEW

**Tier:** 3
**Purpose:** To provide a standardized framework for evaluating core strategic opportunities and risks within any [PROJECT] or [SYSTEM]. This template ensures that critical, often cross-dimensional, strategic elements are systematically identified, assessed, and integrated into the overall analysis.

---

## CRITICAL USAGE INSTRUCTION

This framework MUST be applied during the analysis phase, specifically between Step 3 (Dimension Evaluation) and Step 4 (Root Cause Identification) of the `Methodology Framework`. Its purpose is to ensure that high-level strategic insights, especially those that may be non-obvious or revelatory, are not lost during the synthesis of detailed findings.

---

## HIERARCHICAL CONTEXT

This Tier 3 `strategic_framework` is a critical input for the `Root Cause Analysis` step of the `methodology_framework`. It provides a lens to elevate specific findings into strategic-level root causes and informs the `Strategic Recommendations` (Step 5).

---

## WHEN TO USE

Use this template to:
- Assess the strategic positioning of a [PRODUCT], [SERVICE], or [INITIATIVE].
- Identify non-obvious opportunities for creating a competitive or strategic advantage.
- Ensure that the analysis goes beyond surface-level issues to address fundamental strategic positioning.
- Evaluate potential "breakthrough" opportunities in any [DOMAIN].

---

## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

- **Inputs:** Requires the completed `Dimension Evaluation` (Step 3 of the methodology) and any `[PROJECT]_brief` or other high-level context documents that provide strategic insights.
- **Dependencies:** Must be used to inform the `Root Cause Analysis` (Step 4) and `Strategic Recommendations` (Step 5) in the `Methodology Framework`.
- **Outputs:** A completed `Strategic Elements Verification Table` that feeds into the root cause analysis process.

# [PROJECT_NAME]: Core Strategic Elements Framework

## The [N] Core Strategic Elements

### **1. [CONCEPT] Definition & Leadership Opportunity**
**Definition:** The potential for an [ENTITY] to create, own, redefine, or lead a [CONCEPT], [CATEGORY], or [DOMAIN] in a way that positions them as the definitive solution and thought leader.

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is there an opportunity to establish a new [CONCEPT] or sub-category?
- Could the [ENTITY] redefine an existing [CONCEPT] to its advantage?
- Does the [ENTITY] have proprietary frameworks or terminology that could form the basis of a new [CONCEPT]?
- Do inputs from the `[PROJECT]_brief` suggest an opportunity for [CONCEPT] creation or redefinition?

---

### **2. [ALTERNATIVE] Positioning & Defense Strategy**
**Definition:** The [ENTITY]'s approach to articulating its unique advantages against [ALTERNATIVES] and protecting its position from encroachment.

**Assessment Questions:**
- Are [ALTERNATIVES] actively targeting the [ENTITY]'s user base or key terms?
- Does the [ENTITY] have a clear differentiation framework against primary [ALTERNATIVES]?
- Is there a defensive strategy to protect core concepts and ownership?
- Does the positioning effectively highlight substantive advantages over [ALTERNATIVES]?

---

### **3. Underleveraged Historical Assets**
**Definition:** Historical initiatives, content, data, or achievements that demonstrated positive impact but are currently underutilized.

**Assessment Questions:**
- Are there successful past projects or initiatives that are now "buried" or forgotten?
- Does the [ENTITY] have strong historical data or content that is not prominently featured?
- Are there unique achievements, awards, or milestones that could be better leveraged?
- Could past community engagement or events with positive reception be resurfaced?

---

### **4. Urgency Creation & "Why Now" Messaging**
**Definition:** The effectiveness of messaging in creating a sense of urgency and compelling reasons for [USERS] to act now rather than delaying decisions.

**Assessment Questions:**
- Does the messaging create a clear sense of urgency?
- Is there a compelling "why now" argument beyond general benefits?
- Are external trends, deadlines, or competitive pressures leveraged to create timeliness?
- Are the costs of delay or benefits of early adoption clearly articulated?

---

### **5. Stakeholder Dynamics & Adoption**
**Definition:** The effectiveness in addressing all key stakeholders in a decision-making process, including champions, influencers, evaluators, economic approvers, and potential detractors.

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is content/information available for all relevant stakeholder roles?
- Are potential internal objections or resistance points addressed?
- Are there resources to help internal champions advocate for a decision?
- Is there clear differentiation between user-focused and decision-maker messaging?

---

### **6. [CORE_CAPABILITY] Positioning Authenticity**
**Definition:** For [ENTITIES] with a specialized or technical core capability (e.g., [AI], [DATA_ANALYSIS], [ENGINEERING]), the authenticity and substantiveness of technical claims beyond buzzwords.

**Assessment Questions:**
- Would the [ENTITY] still appear advanced if buzzwords were removed?
- Is there substantial technical content that demonstrates the claimed capabilities?
- Does the [PRIMARY_INTERFACE] (e.g., website, application) reflect the technical sophistication being claimed?
- Is there a balance between technical depth and accessible business/user messaging?

## Strategic Elements Verification Table

Use this table during analysis to ensure comprehensive coverage. Link findings to root causes identified in the `Methodology Framework`.

| Strategic Element | Opportunity Exists? (Yes/No) | Supporting Evidence & Rationale | Related Root Cause | Priority (High/Medium/Low) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. [CONCEPT] Definition & Leadership** | | | | |
| **2. [ALTERNATIVE] Positioning & Defense** | | | | |
| **3. Underleveraged Historical Assets** | | | | |
| **4. Urgency Creation & "Why Now"** | | | | |
| **5. Stakeholder Dynamics & Adoption** | | | | |
| **6. [CORE_CAPABILITY] Positioning Authenticity** | | | | |

## SUCCESS METRICS

- **Integration:** This framework is used in 100% of applicable analysis projects, as verified by the `orchestrator`.
- **Impact:** At least 80% of "High" priority strategic opportunities identified are addressed in the final `Strategic Recommendations`.
- **Insight:** The use of this framework leads to the identification of at least one "non-obvious" or "revelatory" strategic finding per project.
