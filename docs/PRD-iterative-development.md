# Product Requirements Document: MADIO Iterative Development Framework

## Executive Summary

The MADIO Framework currently operates under a "one-time setup" model that assumes users create AI system documents once and deploy them. Real-world usage patterns reveal that users require iterative development capabilities - the ability to continuously add, replace, update, and refine their AI system documents throughout the project lifecycle. Additionally, critical user interaction features like Google Drive folder selection are being bypassed, degrading the user experience. This PRD outlines the structural changes needed to transform MADIO from a static setup tool into a dynamic development framework with proper user interaction flows.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Limitations

- **Single Document Lifecycle**: System assumes documents are created once via `/generate-ai-system` or `/madio-import-docs`
- **Stale Mapping Persistence**: Document-to-Google Doc ID mappings persist indefinitely, causing sync failures when documents are replaced
- **No Lifecycle Management**: No tracking of document creation, modification, or replacement events
- **Poor User Experience**: Users encounter cryptic errors when attempting iterative workflows
- **Brittle Sync Process**: Google Docs sync breaks when attempting to sync to trashed or deleted documents
- **Missing User Interaction**: Google Drive folder selection prompts are bypassed, forcing documents into root folder without user choice

### Impact on User Workflows

1. **Initial Setup â†’ Development Iteration**: Users complete setup, then need to add new specialized documents
2. **Document Replacement**: Users want to replace existing documents with improved versions
3. **Template Evolution**: Users need to upgrade to newer MADIO template versions
4. **Collaborative Development**: Multiple team members contribute documents that need integration
5. **Experimentation**: Users want to test different document combinations without breaking existing setups
6. **Document Organization**: Users cannot organize their Google Docs into proper folders, leading to cluttered Drive structure

## Vision Statement

Enable MADIO users to continuously evolve their AI systems through seamless iterative development workflows, treating AI system documents as living assets that can be created, modified, replaced, and refined throughout the project lifecycle, with full control over document organization and sync preferences.

## Critical Bug Fixes

### BUG-001: Missing Google Drive Folder Selection

**Priority**: Critical

**Description**: During push-to-docs execution, users are not prompted to select Google Drive folder destination, causing documents to be placed in root folder without user choice.

**Root Cause**:
- Environment detection incorrectly identifies interactive terminal as non-interactive
- Claude Code CLI environment may not properly forward stdin to Python subprocess
- Folder selection prompt logic bypassed due to environment detection failure

**Fix Requirements**:
- Implement robust interactive environment detection
- Ensure stdin forwarding works correctly in Claude Code CLI
- Add fallback prompts using alternative input methods if needed
- Provide command-line flags for explicit folder specification
- Test interaction flows in all supported environments

### BUG-002: Stale Document Mapping Persistence

**Priority**: High

**Description**: Document mappings persist after documents are deleted, causing sync failures when users perform iterative workflows.

**Fix Requirements**:
- Implement mapping validation before sync operations
- Add automatic cleanup of stale mappings
- Provide user confirmation for mapping conflicts
- Enable forced regeneration of mappings when needed

## Conclusion

This structural transformation will position MADIO as a true development framework rather than a one-time setup tool. By enabling iterative development workflows and fixing critical user interaction issues, users can continuously evolve their AI systems while maintaining full control over their document organization and sync preferences.

The immediate focus on fixing the Google Drive folder selection issue addresses a critical user experience problem that affects every sync operation. Combined with the iterative development capabilities, this creates a robust foundation for sophisticated AI system development workflows.

**Key Success Factor**: The system must feel natural to users who expect to iterate on their AI systems continuously, with full control over where their documents are organized and how operations proceed.
