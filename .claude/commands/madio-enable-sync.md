# MADIO Enable Google Docs Sync

**OPTIONAL**: Set up Google Docs synchronization for advanced Claude Project integration.

## Command Purpose

This optional command enables Google Docs sync for users who want automatic synchronization between local MADIO documents and Google Docs. This allows Claude Projects to automatically refresh when local files change.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is completely optional. Most MADIO users don't need this feature.**

## When You Might Want This

- You're using Claude Projects as your primary AI platform
- You want automatic document updates in Claude Project knowledge
- You're collaborating with business users who prefer Google Docs
- You're building AI systems that evolve frequently

## When You DON'T Need This

- You're only using OpenAI CustomGPT or Gemini Gems
- You prefer manual document uploads
- You want to keep things simple
- You don't use Google Workspace

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Prerequisites Check

```bash
echo "🔗 MADIO Google Docs Sync Setup (OPTIONAL)"
echo "==========================================="
echo ""
echo "⚠️ IMPORTANT: This feature is completely OPTIONAL"
echo "   Most MADIO users don't need Google Docs sync"
echo "   Only continue if you specifically need automatic"
echo "   document sync for Claude Projects"
echo ""

read -p "Do you want to enable Google Docs sync? (y/N): " ENABLE_SYNC
if [[ ! "$ENABLE_SYNC" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "✅ Skipping Google Docs sync setup"
    echo "   Your MADIO project works perfectly without it!"
    exit 0
fi

# Check if setup already exists
if [ -f ".claude/scripts/credentials.json" ]; then
    echo "✅ Google Docs sync already configured"
    echo "   Run /push-to-docs to sync documents"
    exit 0
fi

# Verify Python installation
if ! command -v python3 &> /dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Python 3 is required for Google Docs sync"
    echo "   Install Python 3 and run this command again"
    echo "   Or skip sync setup entirely - MADIO works fine without it"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Prerequisites check passed"
```

### Phase 2: Google Cloud Setup and Credentials

This step involves configuring Google Cloud to get the necessary `credentials.json` file that allows this script to access your Google Docs.

```bash
echo ""
echo "📋 Google Cloud Setup Required for Credentials"
echo "---------------------------------------------"
echo ""
echo "You will now be guided to set up Google Cloud credentials."
echo "For detailed, step-by-step instructions, please open and follow the guide:"
echo "➡️  docs/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md"
echo ""
echo "Please open 'docs/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md' in your editor or browser now."
echo "It contains important details, including screenshots and troubleshooting."
echo ""
read -p "Press Enter to continue after you have the guide open..."

echo ""
echo "Key tasks you will perform by following 'docs/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md':"
echo "  1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console."
echo "  2. Create or select a Google Cloud Project."
echo "  3. Enable the 'Google Docs API' for that project."
echo "  4. Configure the OAuth Consent Screen."
echo "  5. Create 'OAuth 2.0 Client ID' credentials of type 'Desktop app'."
echo "  6. Download the generated JSON file and RENAME it to 'credentials.json'."
echo ""
echo "IMPORTANT: "
echo "  - Ensure you are logged into the correct Google account in your browser."
echo "  - The credential type MUST be 'Desktop app'."
echo "  - Remember to RENAME the downloaded file to 'credentials.json'."
echo ""

read -p "Have you completed all steps in 'docs/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md' and downloaded/renamed your 'credentials.json' file? (y/N): " CLOUD_SETUP_COMPLETE

if [[ ! "$CLOUD_SETUP_COMPLETE" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo ""
    echo "🔄 No problem! Complete the setup when ready:"
    echo "   1. Follow the Google Cloud setup above"
    echo "   2. Run /madio-enable-sync again"
    echo ""
    echo "💡 Remember: Google Docs sync is optional"
    echo "   Your MADIO project works great without it!"
    exit 0
fi
```

### Phase 3: Credentials Installation

```bash
echo ""
echo "📁 Installing Credentials"
echo "-------------------------"

# Create scripts directory if needed
mkdir -p .claude/scripts

echo "Please provide the path to your downloaded credentials.json file:"
read -p "Credentials file path: " CREDS_PATH

if [ ! -f "$CREDS_PATH" ]; then
    echo "❌ File not found: $CREDS_PATH"
    echo "   Please check the path and try again"
    exit 1
fi

# Copy credentials
cp "$CREDS_PATH" .claude/scripts/credentials.json
echo "✅ Credentials installed to .claude/scripts/credentials.json"

# Secure the credentials file
chmod 600 .claude/scripts/credentials.json
echo "✅ Credentials secured (600 permissions)"
```

### Phase 4: Python Dependencies

```bash
echo ""
echo "🐍 Ensuring Python Environment is Ready..."
echo "---------------------------------------"
echo "This will run the .claude/scripts/setup.sh script to prepare the Python environment."

# Assuming this command is run from the project root directory
SETUP_SCRIPT_PATH=".claude/scripts/setup.sh"

if [ ! -f "$SETUP_SCRIPT_PATH" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Python setup script not found at $SETUP_SCRIPT_PATH"
    echo "   Please ensure you are in the project root and the script exists."
    # For Claude commands, exiting might not be the best. Consider how errors are surfaced.
    # For now, we'll assume the command framework handles script errors.
    # If this were a standalone script, 'exit 1' would be here.
    echo "SCRIPT_ERROR: Python setup script not found. Aborting."
    # Claude CLI might require a specific way to signal error, this is a placeholder.
    # Depending on how Claude CLI handles shell script execution, we might need to adjust error signaling.
    # For now, printing an error and letting it continue might be what happens,
    # or the Claude CLI might halt on non-zero exit codes if we add 'exit 1'.
    # Let's assume for now that we want to halt.
    exit 1 
fi

echo "   Running $SETUP_SCRIPT_PATH ..."
# Make sure setup.sh is executable
chmod +x "$SETUP_SCRIPT_PATH"

# Execute setup.sh and capture its success/failure
if bash "$SETUP_SCRIPT_PATH"; then
    echo "✅ Python environment setup script completed successfully."
    echo "   The Python virtual environment and dependencies should now be installed."
else
    echo "❌ Error: Python environment setup failed."
    echo "   Please review the output from the setup script above for details."
    echo "   You may need to resolve Python/pip issues or other errors shown."
    echo "   Aborting Google Docs Sync enablement."
    exit 1 # Signal error
fi

# Reminder: setup.sh now deactivates the venv itself.
# The following steps in this /madio-enable-sync command that need
# to run python scripts (like the auth test) will need to re-activate it.
echo "   Python environment is prepared for Google Docs Sync."
```

### Phase 5: Sync Configuration

```bash
echo ""
echo "📋 Document Sync Configuration"
echo "------------------------------"
echo ""
echo "Which documents do you want to sync to Google Docs?"
echo ""

# Show available MADIO documents
echo "Available MADIO documents:"

done

echo ""
echo "For each document you want to sync:"
echo "1. Create a new Google Doc"
echo "2. Copy the document ID from the URL"
echo "3. Enter it when prompted below"
echo ""

for file in *.md; do
    if [ -f "$file" ] && [[ ! "$file" =~ ^(README|CLAUDE|GEMINI|madio_core_templates|AI_CONTEXT)\.md$ ]]; then
        echo ""
        read -p "Google Doc ID for $file (press Enter to skip): " DOC_ID

    fi
done

cat >> .claude/scripts/sync_config.json << EOF

}
EOF

echo ""
echo "✅ Sync configuration saved to .claude/scripts/sync_config.json"
```

### Phase 6: First Sync Test

```bash
echo ""
echo "🧪 Testing Sync Setup"
echo "---------------------"

# Test authentication
echo "Testing Google authentication..."
cd .claude/scripts
source venv/bin/activate

python3 -c "
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
import pickle
import os

SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents']

if os.path.exists('token.pickle'):
    with open('token.pickle', 'rb') as token:
        creds = pickle.load(token)
else:
    flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', SCOPES)
    creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
    with open('token.pickle', 'wb') as token:
        pickle.dump(creds, token)

print('✅ Authentication successful')
"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Google authentication successful"
else
    echo "❌ Authentication failed"
    echo "   Check your credentials.json file"
    exit 1
fi

cd - > /dev/null

# Test sync if configuration exists
if [ -s ".claude/scripts/sync_config.json" ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Testing document sync..."
    /push-to-docs
    
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then

    else
        echo "⚠️ Sync test had issues"
        echo "   Check document IDs in sync_config.json"
    fi
fi
```

### Phase 7: Setup Completion

```bash
echo ""
echo "🎉 Google Docs Sync Setup Complete!"
echo "===================================="
echo ""
echo "✅ What was configured:"
echo "   • Google Cloud credentials installed"
echo "   • Python environment with required packages"
echo "   • Document sync mapping configured"
echo "   • Authentication tested and working"
echo ""
echo "🔗 Available Commands:"
echo "   • /push-to-docs - Sync all configured documents"
echo "   • /push-to-docs --file filename.md doc-id - Sync specific file"
echo ""
echo "📋 Next Steps:"
echo "1. Edit your MADIO documents locally"
echo "2. Run /push-to-docs to sync to Google Docs"
echo "3. Your Claude Project will automatically see updates"
echo ""
echo "💡 Pro Tips:"
echo "   • Only sync documents you actively edit"
echo "   • Run /madio-doctor to check sync health"
echo "   • You can disable sync anytime by removing .claude/scripts/"
echo ""
echo "🔄 Development Workflow:"
echo "   Local Edit → /push-to-docs → Claude Project Auto-Updates"
echo ""
echo "Remember: This sync is completely optional!"
echo "MADIO works perfectly without Google Docs integration."
```

## Error Handling

### Google Cloud Issues
- Verify credentials.json validity
- Check API enablement status
- Handle authentication failures gracefully

### Python Environment
- Check Python 3 availability
- Handle virtual environment creation failures
- Provide clear dependency installation errors

### Configuration Validation
- Validate Google Doc IDs
- Check file permissions
- Ensure sync mapping is correct

## Integration Notes

- Only runs when explicitly requested
- Doesn't interfere with core MADIO functionality
- Can be completely removed without affecting MADIO
- Works alongside existing /push-to-docs command

## Removal Instructions

To completely remove Google Docs sync:
```bash
rm -rf .claude/scripts/
```

Your MADIO project will continue working perfectly without sync.
